I'm trying to build a web resource HTML page that loads a Javascript function when the dashboard is loaded. Once the dashboard is loaded, run a function that gets the User GUID and checks if the ramcosub_loggedin is false. If so, check all of the Teams the user is in. For each team, Get the Open and Closed Hours Of Operation String from each team, convert it to Time objects and compare it to the time the event happened. If the event is within the hours, create a User Login record and set the Lookup field to the Team record. Otherwise, go to the next team in the for loop until end of records.  Once done, go to the User record and update the ramcosub_loggedin field to true.
